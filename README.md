# NMEA-PARSER

GNSS data is recorded from a NV08C-RTK-A device.
Post-processing data takes NMEA data and represents the movement of the device through space. It extracts velocity, distance, inclination and other data.
Matlab code represents the real time position and real time inclination through Matlab environment. It is possible to add the window to show the distance to a defined line.
